# Feline Dental Health Guide

## Introduction: Why Feline Dental Health Matters

Dental health is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of overall feline wellness. More than 70% of cats over the age of three suffer from some form of periodontal disease, which can lead to pain, tooth loss, and systemic health issues affecting the heart, liver, and kidneys. By understanding and proactively managing your cat's oral health, you can significantly improve their quality of life and longevity.

## Understanding Periodontal Disease in Cats

Periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition affecting the tissues that surround and support the teeth—the gums, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone. It begins with the accumulation of plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that forms on teeth daily. If not removed, plaque mineralizes into calculus (tartar) within 24-48 hours. The bacteria beneath the calculus release toxins that cause gingivitis (inflammation of the gums). Left untreated, this inflammation progresses to destroy the deeper periodontal structures, leading to periodontitis, bone loss, and eventual tooth loss.

The disease progresses through four stages:
- **Stage 1 (Gingivitis)**: Reversible inflammation of the gums without attachment loss.
- **Stage 2 (Early Periodontitis)**: Up to 25% attachment loss; early bone loss visible on dental radiographs.
- **Stage 3 (Moderate Periodontitis)**: 25-50% attachment loss; moderate bone loss and possible tooth mobility.
- **Stage 4 (Advanced Periodontitis)**: More than 50% attachment loss; severe bone loss, tooth mobility, and potential tooth root exposure.

## Recognizing the Early Signs of Dental Problems

Cats are masters at hiding pain, so owners must be vigilant for subtle signs of dental disease. Early detection allows for intervention before irreversible damage occurs.

**Common signs include:**
- Bad breath (halitosis)
- Red, swollen, or bleeding gums
- Visible yellow or brown tartar on teeth
- Drooling or pawing at the mouth
- Reluctance to eat, especially dry food
- Chewing on one side of the mouth or dropping food
- Weight loss or decreased appetite
- Behavioral changes (irritability, hiding)

**What to look for during a home examination:**
Gently lift your cat's lip to inspect the teeth and gums. Healthy gums should be pink, firm, and without redness or swelling. Teeth should be white and free of brown deposits. Any abnormalities should prompt a veterinary visit.

## The Importance of Professional Dental Cleanings

While daily home care is essential, professional dental cleanings (prophylaxis) performed under general anesthesia are the cornerstone of feline dental health. These cleanings allow for a thorough assessment and treatment that cannot be achieved in a conscious animal.

**What happens during a professional dental cleaning:**
1. **Pre‑anesthetic evaluation**: Blood work and physical exam to ensure safe anesthesia.
2. **General anesthesia**: Induced to eliminate stress and pain, and to allow complete access to the oral cavity.
3. **Full‑mouth dental radiographs (X‑rays)**: Essential to evaluate disease below the gumline, where 60% of dental pathology occurs.
4. **Supragingival scaling**: Removal of plaque and calculus above the gumline using ultrasonic and hand scalers.
5. **Subgingival scaling**: Cleaning beneath the gumline to eliminate plaque from periodontal pockets.
6. **Polishing**: Smoothing the tooth surfaces to slow future plaque accumulation.
7. **Fluoride or other preventive treatments** (if indicated).
8. **Detailed charting**: Recording of periodontal probing depths, mobility, and any abnormalities.

**Frequency of cleanings** depends on the individual cat’s risk factors, but most cats benefit from a professional cleaning every 6–12 months once periodontal disease is present. Cats with excellent home care and no evidence of disease may only need cleaning every 1–2 years.
